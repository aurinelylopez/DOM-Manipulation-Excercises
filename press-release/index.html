<p>General Assembly has an ambitious vision for the future. We are working toward a world in which we can close the global skills gap, ensuring that everyone,regardless of social or economic barriers, has access to the training they need to pursue a career they love. To achieve this goal, we work closely with employers to understand the workforce they need, and then empower students and employees with these skills.</p><br>

<section>Our Commitment is getting noticed.</section><br>
<p>In September, MIT honored General Assembly as a finalist in its Inclusive Innovation Competition. The contest identifies and celebrates organizations that are inventing a more inclusive, productive, and sustainable future for all. Like us, they see the importance of a network of organizations learning from one another and working together to solve important social challenges.
